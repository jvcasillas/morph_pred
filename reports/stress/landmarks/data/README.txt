Phonotactic frequencies
=======================

- http://www.people.ku.edu/~mvitevit/VLbrmic.pdf


- Provides...
	- position-specific probability for each segment
	- biphone probability for each segment pair
- We use... 
	- the sum of all the position-specific phoneme probabilities and 
	- the sum of all the biphone probabilities.
